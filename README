Belgian eid card test application
===================================
based on http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x1dARGV_zEQ&html5=1

This is a "starter" application for getting started with develloping web
applications in netbeans with the belgian eid card's.

makes use of the eid-applet (http://code.google.com/p/eid-applet/)

all the magic is in the pom.xml...

just open this folder as a maven project in netbeans, start the application
(maven will download all necessities )
and browse to https://localhost:8181/beidtest/ to see it working

known issues
-------------
Tested in netbeans 6.9.1 with glassfish 3.0.1

Warning, doesn't work with glassfish 3.1
(I got "ERROR: no session cookie detected!"  and "java.lang.RuntimeException: expected a protocol start message" )
use 3.0.1 instead from
http://dlc.sun.com.edgesuite.net/glassfish/3.0.1/release/

after installing this (run as administrator in windows)
go to the services tab in netbeans, richtclick servers, add server, glassfish server 3
and select the path where you installed glassfish.

or (untested) workaround for glassfish 3.1 (can't seem to install glassfish 3.0.1 in netbeans 7)
For AppletService appletparameter use something like:
      AppletService : 'identification;jsessionid=<%=session.getId()%>'
within your JSP page where the eID Applet gets loaded.
